# classique
Implementations of classic machine learning algorithms.

Currently the following algorithms are available (each file contains basic tests):
1. [K-Nearest Neighbors](models/k_nearest_neighbors.py)
2. [Logistic Regression](models/logistic_regression.py)
3. [Decision Tree](models/decision_tree.py)
4. [Random Forest](models/random_forest.py)
5. [Gradient Boosting](models/gradient_boosting.py)


Also some common metrics are available:
1. [Metrics](helper/metrics.py)
